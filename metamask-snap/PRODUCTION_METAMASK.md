# Installing EthVaultPQ Snap in Production MetaMask

## Current Status

‚úÖ **Published to NPM**: `@qkey/ethvaultpq-snap@0.1.1`
‚ö†Ô∏è **Works with**: MetaMask Flask (developer version)
üî¥ **Not yet available**: Production MetaMask (requires directory listing)

## Why It Only Works with Flask

MetaMask has two versions:
1. **MetaMask Flask** - Developer preview with experimental features
   - Allows installing any Snap from NPM
   - No approval needed
   - Used for testing

2. **MetaMask (Production)** - Regular version used by millions
   - Requires Snaps to be listed in official directory
   - Needs MetaMask team review/approval
   - Protects users from unvetted Snaps

## How to Get Listed in MetaMask Snaps Directory

### Step 1: Prepare Your Snap

**Requirements:**
- ‚úÖ Published to NPM (done!)
- ‚úÖ Working Snap manifest (done!)
- ‚úÖ README with clear description (done!)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Icon/logo for Snap (recommended)
- ‚ö†Ô∏è Audit report (recommended for security Snaps)
- ‚úÖ Open source repository (done!)

### Step 2: Create Snap Metadata

Create a file at root of your repo: `snap.manifest.json` should include:

```json
{
  "proposedName": "EthVaultPQ",
  "description": "Post-quantum secure wallet with Dilithium3 signatures and ZK-SNARK proofs",
  "repository": {
    "type": "git",
    "url": "https://github.com/qkeyco/EthVaultPQ.git"
  },
  "source": {
    "shasum": "...",
    "location": {
      "npm": {
        "packageName": "@qkey/ethvaultpq-snap"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

### Step 3: Submit to Directory

1. **Visit**: https://snaps.metamask.io/submit

   - Category: Security / Wallet Management
   - GitHub repo: https://github.com/qkeyco/EthVaultPQ

3. **Review process**: MetaMask team will:
   - Review code for security
   - Test functionality
   - Check permissions usage
   - Verify description accuracy
   - Approve or request changes

### Step 4: Wait for Approval

- **Timeline**: Usually 1-4 weeks
- **Status**: Check email for updates

### Step 5: Go Live!

Once approved:
- ‚úÖ Snap appears in MetaMask Snaps directory
