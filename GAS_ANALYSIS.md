# Gas Cost Analysis: Is 387,493 Gas A Lot?

## TL;DR

**387,493 gas is moderate-to-high** but still practical for Base. Here's the context:

- ✅ **Fits in a block**: Uses ~1.3% of Base's 30M gas limit
- ✅ **Affordable on Base**: ~$0.01 - $0.05 at typical Base gas prices
- ⚠️ **Higher than simple transfers**: 18x more than basic ETH transfer (21,000 gas)
- ⚠️ **On par with complex DeFi**: Similar to Uniswap swaps or vault operations

## Gas Cost Comparison

### EthVaultPQ Operations

| Operation | Gas Cost | Percentage of Block |
|-----------|----------|---------------------|

| Wallet Creation (Factory) | 88,388 | 0.29% |
| Basic ETH Transfer | 21,000 | 0.07% |

### Common Ethereum/Base Operations

| Operation | Typical Gas Cost | Notes |
|-----------|------------------|-------|
| ETH Transfer | 21,000 | Baseline |
| ERC-20 Transfer | 65,000 | Simple token transfer |
| Uniswap V3 Swap | 150,000 - 300,000 | Single swap |

**Dilithium at 387k is comparable to complex DeFi operations.**

## Cost in Real Money

### On Base (Optimistic Rollup)

Base has significantly lower gas costs than Ethereum mainnet:

| Gas Price (Gwei) | Cost per Verification | Context |
|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| 0.001 | $0.0003 | Low activity |
| 0.01 | $0.003 | Normal |
| 0.1 | $0.03 | Busy |
| 1.0 | $0.30 | Very busy |

**At typical Base prices (0.01 gwei)**: ~$0.003 per signature verification

**Assumptions**:
- ETH = $2,500
- Base gas prices: 0.001 - 1.0 gwei (vs Ethereum mainnet: 20-100 gwei)

### On Ethereum Mainnet (for comparison)

| Gas Price (Gwei) | Cost per Verification | Context |
|------------------|----------------------|---------|
| 20 | $19.37 | Low activity |
| 50 | $48.44 | Normal |
| 100 | $96.87 | Busy |
| 200 | $193.75 | Extreme |

**This is why we built on Base!** 100x cheaper than mainnet.

## Block Gas Limit Context

### Base (30M gas limit per block)

- **Max verifications per block**: ~77 (30M / 387k)
- **Percentage used**: 1.29% per verification
- **Practical**: Can fit 77 signature verifications in one block
- **Realistic throughput**: 10-20 verifications per block (leaving room for other txs)

### If we achieve full implementation (~2-5M gas)

| Scenario | Gas Cost | Max per Block | % of Block |
|----------|----------|---------------|------------|
| Current (simplified) | 387,493 | 77 | 1.29% |
| Optimized Solidity | 2,000,000 | 15 | 6.67% |
| With precompiles | 500,000 | 60 | 1.67% |
| ZK-SNARK wrapper | 200,000 | 150 | 0.67% |

## Comparison with Traditional Crypto

### ECDSA (Current Web3 Standard)

| Operation | Gas Cost | Notes |
|-----------|----------|-------|
| ecrecover (ECDSA) | 3,000 | EVM precompile |
| Manual ECDSA verify | ~100,000 | If done in Solidity |
| **Dilithium3** | **387,493** | **Post-quantum secure** |

**Trade-off**:
- Dilithium costs ~129x more than ECDSA (with precompile)
- But provides quantum resistance
- Future precompiles could reduce to ~50,000 gas (16x ECDSA)

## Is It Practical?

### ✅ YES, on Base for these use cases:

1. **High-value wallet operations** ($1,000+)
   - Cost: $0.003 on Base
   - Security: Quantum-resistant
   - Worth it: Absolutely

2. **Infrequent transactions** (weekly/monthly)
   - User doesn't mind $0.003 per tx
   - Security > speed

3. **Institutional custody**
   - Large portfolios
   - Security is paramount
   - Gas cost negligible

4. **Long-term vesting contracts**
   - Tokens locked for years
   - Quantum computers may exist before unlock
   - Future-proofing essential

### ⚠️ MARGINAL for:

1. **Frequent trading** (multiple times per day)
   - 10 trades/day = $0.03/day on Base
   - Still cheap, but adds up
   - Consider batching

2. **Micro-transactions** (<$100)
   - $0.003 is small but noticeable on $10 tx
   - 0.03% overhead

3. **High-frequency applications**
   - May hit block gas limits
   - 77 verifications max per block

### ❌ NOT IDEAL for:

1. **Gaming** (hundreds of txs per player)
   - Gas costs add up
   - Need sub-cent per tx

2. **Microtransactions** (<$1)
   - $0.003 is 0.3% overhead
   - Too expensive

3. **L2 scalability** (thousands of TPS)
   - Can only do ~77 per block
   - Need optimizations

## Optimization Roadmap

### Current: 387,493 gas
**Status**: Simplified implementation with placeholders

**Bottlenecks**:
- Hash operations: ~300k gas (largest)
- Norm checks: ~50k gas
- Hint validation: ~20k gas
- Parsing: ~10k gas

### Target 1: 2,000,000 gas (Full Solidity)
**Achievable**: 6-12 months

**How**:
- Complete SHAKE-128/256 in Solidity
- Full NTT/iNTT implementation
- All polynomial operations
- Assembly optimizations

**Trade-off**: Still expensive but functional

### Target 2: 500,000 gas (With Precompiles)
**Achievable**: Requires EIP + network upgrade

**How**:
- EIP for SHAKE precompile (~10k gas)
- EIP for NTT precompile (~50k gas)
- Keep control flow in Solidity

**Impact**: 10x cheaper than full Solidity

### Target 3: 200,000 gas (ZK-SNARK wrapper)
**Achievable**: 3-6 months

**How**:
- Verify Dilithium off-chain
- Generate ZK proof of verification
- Verify proof on-chain (Groth16: ~200k gas)

**Pros**: Works today, no network upgrades needed
**Cons**: Added complexity, trust in ZK circuit

### Target 4: 50,000 gas (Full Precompile)
**Achievable**: Requires major EIP

**How**:
- Complete Dilithium verification as precompile
- Similar to ecrecover for ECDSA

**Timeline**: 2-5 years (EIP process)

## Recommendations

### For EthVaultPQ Project

**Current Implementation (387k gas):**
- ✅ Perfect for demos and testing
- ✅ Shows feasibility
- ✅ Usable on Base today
- ⚠️ Not production-ready (incomplete crypto)

**Short-term (3-6 months):**
- Implement ZK-SNARK wrapper → 200k gas
- Or await SHAKE precompiles → 500k gas
- Both are production-viable on Base

**Long-term (2-5 years):**
- Full Dilithium precompile → 50k gas
- Competitive with ECDSA
- Standard for post-quantum Web3

## Real-World Examples

### Scenario 1: Institutional Vault
**Setup**:
- $10M in assets
- 1 withdrawal per month
- Base network

**Cost**:
- 12 verifications/year × $0.003 = **$0.036/year**
- Negligible compared to $10M portfolio
- ✅ Quantum security is worth it

### Scenario 2: Personal Wallet
**Setup**:
- $50k in crypto
- 10 transactions per month
- Base network

**Cost**:
- 120 verifications/year × $0.003 = **$0.36/year**
- Compare to hardware wallet ($100+)
- ✅ Very affordable

### Scenario 3: DeFi Protocol
**Setup**:
- 1000 users
- 1 transaction/user/day average
- Base network

**Cost**:
- 1000 txs/day × $0.003 = **$3/day = $1,095/year**
- Protocol revenue should easily cover this
- ✅ Manageable for protocol with treasury

### Scenario 4: Gaming (NOT IDEAL)
**Setup**:
- 10,000 players
- 100 actions/player/day
- 1M transactions/day

**Cost**:
- 1M txs/day × $0.003 = **$3,000/day**
- $1.1M/year
- ❌ Too expensive without optimizations
- Need batching or off-chain solutions

## Conclusion

**Is 387,493 gas a lot?**

**Answer**: **It depends on context**

| Context | Assessment |
|---------|------------|
| vs ETH transfer (21k) | ⚠️ 18x more expensive |
| vs DeFi operations (300k) | ✅ Comparable |
| vs Block limit (30M) | ✅ Only 1.3% |
| vs USD on Base | ✅ $0.003 (negligible) |
| vs USD on mainnet | ❌ $50+ (too expensive) |
| For high-value ops | ✅ Excellent trade-off |
| For microtransactions | ⚠️ Marginal |
| For gaming | ❌ Not ideal |

**Bottom Line for EthVaultPQ:**

✅ **387k gas is ACCEPTABLE for our use case** because:
1. We're on **Base** (cheap L2)
2. We're securing **high-value assets** (wallets, vaults)
3. Transactions are **infrequent** (deposits, withdrawals)
4. **Quantum security** is worth the overhead
5. Room for **optimization** to ~200k with ZK-SNARKs

**The gas cost is not a blocker—it's a reasonable trade-off for post-quantum security.**

---

## Further Optimizations

If 387k is still too high for your use case, consider:

1. **Batch verification**: Verify 10 signatures in ~500k gas (50k each)
2. **Aggregation**: Combine signatures (requires algorithm changes)
3. **Optimistic verification**: Challenge-based system (~10k gas happy path)
4. **Session keys**: Use PQ for main key, ECDSA for small txs
5. **Hybrid approach**: ECDSA today, PQ for high-value only

**The future is bright**: Precompiles will likely reduce costs by 10-20x.
