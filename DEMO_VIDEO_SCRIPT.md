# EthVaultPQ - 3 Minute Demo Video Script
## Shot-by-Shot Guide with Timings

## üé¨ SECTION 1: THE HOOK (0:00 - 0:30)

### Shot 1.1: Opening Title Card (0:00 - 0:05)
**Screen:** Black background with text fade-in
```
EthVaultPQ
Quantum-Safe Vesting for PYUSD
```

**Audio:**
```
[No speaking - let title breathe for 2 seconds]
```

**Action:** Fade in title, hold 3 seconds, fade out

---

### Shot 1.2: The Problem (0:05 - 0:15)
**Screen:** Show code or diagram of ECDSA signature being broken

**Script:**
```
"Traditional crypto wallets use ECDSA signatures.
When quantum computers become powerful enough,
they'll break these in minutes using Shor's algorithm."
```

**Pacing:** Speak clearly, moderate pace (10 seconds)

**Visual Suggestion:**
- Show ECDSA equation or diagram
- Red "X" or "VULNERABLE" overlay
- Optional: Show "2030" timeline

---

### Shot 1.3: The Solution (0:15 - 0:30)
**Screen:** Switch to EthVaultPQ logo or dashboard homepage

**Script:**
```
"EthVaultPQ solves this TODAY with Dilithium3 post-quantum
cryptography - the NIST standard that's quantum-resistant.

This is a quantum-safe vesting system for PYUSD with
MetaMask Snap integration. Let me show you how it works."
```

**Pacing:** Emphasize "TODAY" and "NIST standard" (15 seconds)

## üé¨ SECTION 2: ARCHITECTURE (0:30 - 1:00)

### Shot 2.1: Full Architecture Diagram (0:30 - 1:00)
**Screen:** Display DEMO_ARCHITECTURE_DIAGRAM.md (the ASCII diagram we just created)

**Script:**
```
"Here's how the complete flow works:

[Point to top]
First, the user generates Dilithium3 keys in a MetaMask Snap -
that's a secure mini-app inside MetaMask.

[Point to middle-top]
Second, we deploy a PQWallet - an ERC-4337 smart contract wallet
that ONLY accepts quantum-resistant signatures.

[Point to middle]
Third, we create a vesting schedule. 100,000 MUSDC locked for
60 months, vesting to the quantum-safe wallet.

[Point to bottom]
Finally, when tokens vest, the user signs with Dilithium3.
We verify it off-chain with a ZK-SNARK proof, saving 99.5%
on gas costs - that's 50 million gas down to just 250,000.

Let me show you this live."

- Long pauses or "umms"
- Rushing through numbers
- Apologizing for loading times

---

## üí° PRO TIPS

**Voice:**

- Use cursor to point at specific elements

**Editing:**
- Speed up loading screens slightly (1.2x speed)
- Cut dead air between sections
- Keep transitions quick (0.5-1 second fades)
- Add subtle zoom on important text

**Common Pitfalls:**
- ‚ùå Don't spend too long on MetaMask confirmations
- ‚ùå Don't read every word on screen
- ‚ùå Don't explain the code - explain the benefit
- ‚ùå Don't rush the ending - stick the landing!

- Section 5: Differentiator (1:30-2:00) ‚Üê KEEP ending

**Cut:**
- Section 4: Tenderly explorer (save 15-30 sec)
- Detailed review screen (just show it, don't explain)
- Some architecture detail

---

## üé¨ ALTERNATIVE: 4-MINUTE EXTENDED

If you have 4 minutes:

**Add:**
- +0:30: Show Snap installation process
- +0:30: Show PQWallet creation wizard

- [ ] Clearly explain the quantum threat (30 sec)
- [ ] Show the full deployment flow (60 sec)
- [ ] Demonstrate production-ready UI
- [ ] Highlight key differentiators (gas savings, NIST)
- [ ] Leave viewers wanting to try it
- [ ] Stay under 3:30 total runtime

**Viewer takeaways:**
