## üéØ 3-MINUTE SCRIPT: WEBSITE WALKTHROUGH

### [0:00-0:30] THE HOOK & HOMEPAGE

**Screen:** Browser at dashboard homepage

**Script:**
```
"Hey everyone. Traditional crypto wallets use ECDSA signatures
that quantum computers will break using Shor's algorithm.

EthVaultPQ solves this TODAY with Dilithium3 - a NIST-approved
post-quantum signature scheme.

This is a complete quantum-safe vesting system for PayPal USD,
integrated right into MetaMask as a Snap.

Let me show you how it works."
```

**Actions:**
- Show homepage briefly (5 sec)
- Mouse over "Vesting" tab
- Quick pan across the UI

**Time:** 30 seconds

---

### [0:30-1:00] EXPLAIN THE FLOW (WHILE NAVIGATING)

**Screen:** Click into Vesting tab

**Script:**
```
"Here's how the complete flow works:

[Point to green "Quick Demo Mode" box]
First, I generate Dilithium3 quantum-resistant keys in a MetaMask
Snap - that's already done.

[Scroll down slightly]
Then I deploy a PQWallet - an ERC-4337 smart contract wallet
that only accepts quantum-resistant signatures. Also done.

[Point to form]
Now I'll create a vesting schedule: lock up 100,000 PYUSD tokens
for 60 months, vesting to my quantum-safe wallet.

[Point to test mode indicator]
I'm using test mode where 1 minute equals 1 month, so we can
actually see this work.

Let's do it."
```

**Actions:**
- Click "Vesting" tab

### [2:15-2:35] SUCCESS & TENDERLY

**Screen:** Success page, then Tenderly

**Script:**
```
"Success! 100,000 PYUSD locked in a quantum-safe vesting schedule.
The beneficiary is my PQWallet protected by Dilithium3 signatures.

[Show Tenderly link]
Let me show you this on Tenderly...

### [2:35-3:00] THE CLOSER

**Screen:** Switch back to dashboard OR stay on Tenderly

**Script:**
```
"So here's what makes this special:

It uses Dilithium3 - the NIST standard for post-quantum
cryptography. Not experimental, production-grade crypto.

The signatures are verified using ZK-SNARKs, which saves
99.5% on gas costs. That's 50 million gas down to 250,000.

It's integrated into MetaMask as a Snap - no separate app,
no new seed phrase, just install and use.

And it's supporting real assets - PYUSD, PayPal's stablecoin,
for actual employee vesting and tax withholding.

This is production ready, deployed on Tenderly Ethereum today,
and ready for mainnet after audits.

The future of crypto security is here - quantum-safe vesting
you can use right now."
```

**Actions:**
- Switch back to dashboard (or stay on Tenderly)
- Mouse over logo
- Slow zoom on the UI (last 5 seconds)
- Fade to black

**Pacing:**
- Speak clearly and confidently
- Pause briefly after key stats (99.5%, NIST, etc.)
- End with energy

**Time:** 25 seconds

## üí° PRO TIPS FOR LIVE WALKTHROUGH

### DO:
‚úÖ **Talk while pages load** - Fill dead air with context
‚úÖ **Use cursor to point** - "Notice this here..."
‚úÖ **Acknowledge wait times** - "While this confirms..."
‚úÖ **Show genuine reactions** - "And... yes! There it is."
‚úÖ **Keep moving** - Don't linger too long on any screen

### DON'T:
‚ùå **Don't apologize** - No "sorry for the wait"
‚ùå **Don't read screens** - Explain, don't read
‚ùå **Don't rush** - Let important moments breathe
‚ùå **Don't go silent** - Always be talking
‚ùå **Don't hide errors** - If something breaks, acknowledge it

### HANDLING WAITS:
**During MetaMask confirmations:**
```
"While this confirms, I'll mention that these signatures
are verified using ZK-SNARKs off-chain, which is how we
get those massive gas savings..."
```

**During transaction confirmations:**
```
"This is deploying to Tenderly Ethereum right now.
In production, this same flow works on mainnet..."
```

---

## üé¨ BACKUP PLAN: If Something Breaks

**If MetaMask fails:**
```
"Looks like MetaMask needs a refresh - in production
this is seamless, but for the demo let me show you
what the success looks like..."
```
[Switch to Tenderly, show a pre-deployed example]

**If transaction fails:**
```
"Transaction didn't go through - that sometimes happens
on testnets. But you can see the UI flow is complete,
and here's what a successful deployment looks like..."
```
[Have a backup screenshot or previous successful deployment ready]

**Best Practice:**
- Do a full test run before recording
- Have Tenderly open with a backup successful transaction
- Record 2-3 takes so you have options

---

## üìä SUCCESS CHECKLIST

After recording, your video should show:
- [ ] Clear problem statement (quantum threat)
