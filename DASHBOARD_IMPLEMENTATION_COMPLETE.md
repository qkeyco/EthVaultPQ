## Demo Vesting Contract

### PQVault4626Demo.sol

**Acceleration Factor:** 60x

**Time Conversion:**
- 1 minute real-time = 1 hour in demo
- 30 minutes real-time = 1 month in demo
- 3 hours real-time = 6 months in demo
- 6 hours real-time = 1 year in demo

**Perfect for:**
- Live demonstrations
- Quick testing
- User education
- Conference presentations

**Example:**
```solidity
// Deploy with 30-day vesting
vault.depositWithVesting(amount, receiver, 30 days, 0);

// Wait ~30 minutes in real-time
// Vesting is complete!
```

---

## Getting Started

### 1. Setup Environment

```bash
cd dashboard
cp .env.example .env.local
```

Edit `.env.local`:
```bash
VITE_NETWORK=tenderly
VITE_TENDERLY_RPC_URL=https://virtual.mainnet.eu.rpc.tenderly.co/YOUR_FORK_ID
```

### 2. Install and Run

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

### 3. Open Dashboard

Navigate to [http://localhost:5173](http://localhost:5173)

You should see the Deploy tab as the default view!

### Sepolia Testnet

**After Tenderly validation**

**Setup:**
1. Get RPC from Infura or Alchemy

1. Start dev server: `npm run dev`
2. Open http://localhost:5173
3. Click "Deploy" tab (should be selected by default)
4. See network selector (Tenderly selected)
5. See 8 contracts listed
6. See deployment progress bar (0/8)
7. Each contract shows "Deploy" button
8. Dependencies are enforced (greyed out if deps not met)

### Full Test (After Tenderly Setup)

1. Configure Tenderly RPC in `.env.local`
2. Connect wallet to Tenderly network
3. Deploy contracts in order:
   - Groth16Verifier
   - PQValidator
   - PQWalletFactory
   - MockToken
   - PQVault4626
   - PQVault4626Demo
   - ZKProofOracle
   - QRNGOracle
4. Verify each contract
5. Test each contract
6. Progress bar should show 8/8

---

## Demo Vesting Test

### Setup
1. Deploy MockToken
2. Deploy PQVault4626Demo
3. Approve MockToken for vault
4. Deposit with 30-day vesting

### Fast-Forward Test
```
Deposit: 1000 tokens, 30-day vesting
Wait: ~30 minutes real-time
Result: Full vesting unlocked!
```

### Visual Progress
The UI should show:
- Vesting start time
- Current progress (%)
- Vested amount
- Withdrawable amount
- Time remaining (in demo time)

- Real-time updates on deployment

### Contract Deployment Flow
```
1. User clicks "Deploy" on Groth16Verifier
2. State updates to "deploying"
3. Smart contract deployment transaction
4. Wait for confirmation
5. State updates to "deployed" with address
6. User clicks "Verify"
7. Contract verified on explorer
8. State updates to "verified"
9. Next contract unlocks (PQValidator)
10. Repeat for all 8 contracts
