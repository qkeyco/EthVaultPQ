---

## 🎯 Achievements

### Test Fixes: 94% Pass Rate Achieved! 🎉

**Before Session:**
- Foundry: 12/21 (57%)
- Vitest: 29/33 (88%)
- Overall: 41/54 core tests (76%)

**After Session:**
- Foundry: 25/29 (86%) ✅
- Vitest: 33/33 (100%) ✅
- Overall: 58/62 core tests (94%) ✅

## 🔧 Critical Bugs Fixed

### 1. Constructor Parameter Shadowing (PQWallet & PQWalletFactory)
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Impact:** PQValidator was never initialized, causing "Invalid validator" error

```solidity
// BEFORE (BUG):
constructor(..., IPQValidator _validator) {
    _validator = _validator;  // ❌ Assigns parameter to itself!
}

// AFTER (FIXED):
constructor(..., IPQValidator validator_) {
    _validator = validator_;  // ✅ Assigns to state variable
}
```

**Result:** Fixed ALL 9 PQWallet tests (0/9 → 9/9)

---

### 2. PQVault Time/Block Conversion Mismatch
**Severity:** HIGH
**Impact:** All vesting tests failing

**Issue:** Tests passed block counts, but function expects time in seconds
```solidity
// BEFORE (WRONG):
vault.depositWithVesting(amount, user, 2_628_000, 216_000);  // blocks

// AFTER (CORRECT):
vault.depositWithVesting(amount, user, 365 days, 30 days);  // seconds
```

**Result:** Fixed ALL 4 PQVault vesting tests (3/7 → 7/7)

---

### 3. Vitest Block Calculation Test Expectations
**Severity:** MEDIUM
**Impact:** 4 unit tests failing

**Issue:** Test expectations were 10x off, implementation was correct!
```typescript
// BEFORE (WRONG EXPECTATION):
expect(monthsToBlocks(60, false)).toBe(1_296_000);  // ❌ Off by 10x

// AFTER (CORRECT):
expect(monthsToBlocks(60, false)).toBe(12_960_000); // ✅ Correct math
```

**Result:** Fixed ALL 4 Vitest tests (29/33 → 33/33)

---

## 🎓 Key Learnings

1. **Constructor parameter shadowing is subtle but critical**
   - `_validator = _validator` looks correct but isn't
   - Solution: Use different parameter names (e.g., `validator_`)

2. **Test expectations can be wrong, not just implementation**
   - Vitest block calculations were correct
   - Test expectations were 10x off

3. **ZK-SNARK oracle pattern is the right approach for Dilithium**
   - Direct Solidity verification: Impossible (~50M gas)
   - ZK proof verification: Practical (~250k gas)
   - Off-chain crypto + on-chain proof = Trustless

4. **Grok audit was valuable**
   - Caught NIST parameter mismatches
   - Identified inflation attack vulnerability
   - All P0 findings fixed

---

## 🎯 Remaining Work

### Critical (Mainnet Blockers)
- [ ] Replace Dilithium placeholder (2 weeks) 🔴
- [ ] Professional audit ($50k-100k, 4-6 weeks)

### Important (Testnet Polish)
- [ ] Fix Playwright UI tests (~160 tests)
- [ ] Add Deploy tab to dashboard
- [ ] P1/P2 security fixes (timelocks, multisig)

### Nice to Have
- [ ] Gas optimizations
- [ ] Increase test coverage >95%
- [ ] Run Slither/Mythril/Manticore
